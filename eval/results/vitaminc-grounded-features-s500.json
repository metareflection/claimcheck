However, the claim uses 'shorter than' which means less than. 57 years 246 days IS shorter than 57 years 350 days, so the claim is correct. Wait, let me reconsider: The claim says the reign WAS shorter than 57 years and 350 days. The evidence says it WAS 57 years and 246 days. Since 246 < 350, then 57 years 246 days < 57 years 350 days, which means the reign WAS indeed shorter than 57 years 350 days. This SUPPORTS the claim, not contradicts it."
