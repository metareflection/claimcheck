      "requirement": "The base hue is always in valid range",
      "explanation": "None of the proved claims specifically state that the base hue value is within a valid range (e.g., 0-360 degrees). The general invariant predicate might contain this, but without a specific claim about base hue validity, we cannot confirm coverage."

      "requirement": "There are always exactly 5 colors in the palette",
      "explanation": "No proved claim explicitly states that the palette contains exactly 5 colors. While this might be part of the specification invariant CWSpec.Inv(m), there is no specific claim that documents this property."

    {
      "requirement": "Every color has valid saturation and lightness values",
      "explanation": "No proved claim explicitly states that saturation and lightness values are within valid ranges (typically 0-100%). This property might be part of the specification invariant, but it is not explicitly documented as a separate claim."

      "requirement": "Contrast pair indices are valid (between 0 and 4)",

      "requirement": "When a mood is set (not Custom), all colors satisfy the mood constraints",

  "summary": "The formal verification establishes a general invariant framework (initialization, preservation, and application preconditions) but does not provide explicit proofs for any of the six specific user requirements about colorwheel properties (hue ranges, palette size, color value validity, contrast indices, mood constraints, and harmony patterns). All proved claims are structural verification obligations rather than domain-specific property proofs, resulting in zero coverage of the stated requirements."
